                `Garrett is so special to me! He was one of the first friends I made at BYUH. We bonded instantly over both being surfers from California and took pride in being from the same place. I could write a whole book about all the things I experienced with him!

                One of my favorite memories was when he called me one time from Grandpa Nichols’ house saying he accidentally drained the oil from his car and didn’t have any new oil to put in it cause grandpa said he had new oil for him but it ended up being old oil. He called me and asked me to pick him up and take him to the store.. we ended up getting the oil and calling it a day and went and got burritos after. I’ll never forget how hard we were both laughing just staring at the green machine, oil less and all.

                Another favorite memory I have is when Garrett “accidentally” Venmoed me a thousand dollars. I was on a flight home and my phone connected to the WiFi and I got a Venmo notification saying that he sent me a thousand dollars. He proceeded to comment on his Venmo by saying that he meant to request it as a joke. Let’s just say he was waiting for my plane to land on the dot. He didn’t see any money being taken from his account and when I told him it would take a day or so to process he said “No way. We just created money from thin air”. When I asked him what he wanted to do he said “LETS DO IT AGAIN”. I ended up sending all his money back! When I got back to the island he requested me on Venmo and asked me to pay him twenty thousand dollars. It was so funny.

                From surfing together to green machine rap battles to endless temple trips to Sunday dinners at grandpas to fun trips to town to underwater cave diving to flips off Waimea rock to wedding crashers to so many catch up phone calls, I’m so so grateful I knew Garrett. He has changed my life and has pushed me to be a better Disciple of Jesus Christ every day since the day I met him. His example still pushes me to be better and always will.

                Thanks for everything Gary! I miss you like a banshee!`,
