You've inspired me to be a better father, husband, and follower of the savior.

Your example of hard work, goal setting, and seizing every opportunity life has to offer has changed my life forever. I will remember all the little sounds you made and the infectious energy you always had. I miss you Garrett. I love you brother. Until we meet again.  `,

One of my best friends from BYU-H passed away this week. It broke my heart. 

Garrett was an upper classman and I was a brand new freshman. It didn‚Äôt matter to Garrett. He was a friend to all and we were immediately tight.

Garrett Nicholas was a true example of Christ. His priceless smile and contagious energy was something that everyone appreciated.

From early morning surf sessions to weekly evening temple trips, from landscaping to ice cream runs, Garrett always emanated the light of Christ.

It didn't matter if we were jamming to new music we'd found or ""shot-gunning‚Äù La Croix.

He didn't need to wear a cross or a name tag to show that he was a disciple of Jesus Christ.

He lived 3 Nephi 5:13.

Everyone knew Garrett loved Jesus Christ.

He will be greatly missed. How thankful I am for his example.

The plan of salvation is true. It is real. It is HOPE.

My question of contemplation today is how can you emanate the light of Christ?

How can you show that you are HIS disciple?

How can you be that example?

I love that to live like Garrett means many similar things to people and many different things to people. He was such a light and still is! I‚Äôve seen a huge change in my life and my testimony this last year as I strive to live the way he did. I‚Äôm closer to the Savior, I really take time to serve others and help anyone I come across, I‚Äôve surfed more than ever, and so much more. Three stories come to mind today about him. I swear I could write a whole novel about all the things I‚Äôve experienced with him. It was all epic!

First, there was a day where Garrett and I went to Waimea to just swim and have some fun around sunset. There was this little boy who had no one to play with and Garrett ran into him. Obviously Garrett stopped and played with this little boy who was visiting the island and Garrett swam with him and showed him how to dig massive sand holes and ways to have fun in the water. They played for almost two hours. It was a sunset I won‚Äôt ever forget and an act of service I‚Äôll never forget. Garrett showed that boy why he loved the beach so much and it was easy to see that this little boy loved it even more too because of him and his kindness. 

Second, I met Garrett the first day of being at BYUH. There was a huge stake event and I met him outside of the church building. When we walked inside, the first painting we saw on the wall just so happened to be his phone wallpaper. I remember him saying, ‚ÄúLook. My wallpaper matches this painting. It‚Äôs one of my favorites, you know, cause it‚Äôs a reminder that Christ loves all His children. It brings me comfort.‚Äù He had a huge smile on his face, held up his phone, and I took a picture of him. He was stoked. I was stoked. We were all stoked. There was nothing better than being in Hawaii and making new friends who love the Savior too! 

Third, I‚Äôve had some pretty awesome experiences this last year. On January 10th, I bought a new (used) surfboard. I wanted a project. Something to fix up and keep my mind off of things. I struggled to get out and surf last winter. I went and picked up this board, had a quick look at it, and threw it in my car. I didn‚Äôt know how I was gonna surf at that moment honestly. When I got home and pulled the board out, I noticed a sticker at the bottom of the board in between the fins. I must‚Äôve missed it when I glanced at it. This sticker is a stick figure character with a paintbrush in one hand and a green shirt on. The green shirt had some writing in it and when I leaned in to see what it said my heart sank. The writing said ‚ÄúGary‚Äù. That was my nickname for Garrett. I knew it wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. What an emotional and super cool experience. It‚Äôs one of my favorite boards that I‚Äôve ever had. I got back in the water that weekend, felt peaceful and sad all at the same time, and a thought came to mind. There was a time when I went surfing with Garrett and just felt down. I felt kinda weird about being sad and surfing at the same time. How could you be sad while surfing? I told him I was sad and he looked at me and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre allowed to be sad and surf you know that right? You‚Äôll find some peace in it, maybe receive an answer, and have fun when you shred.‚Äù I think about that all the time when I surf. I thought about that on my board with my Gary sticker in that moment on the water. I bought that board a day before his birthday. I‚Äôm so grateful for that experience! 

I miss you like a banshee Gary!! Cowabunga!! "`,

One memory that sticks out, besides all his backflips that he had me record, was in JR highschool (7th grade) he came up to me with this genius idea of a gold catcher. He showed me how it worked, it was a pen he took apart and put a hole in the side of the ink, then would insert into the ground to extract the gold. Needless to say, it did not extract gold from the ground of the JR high yard! But what an amazing memory he gave us! `,

One of my favorite memories was when he called me one time from Grandpa Nichols‚Äô house saying he accidentally drained the oil from his car and didn‚Äôt have any new oil to put in it cause grandpa said he had new oil for him but it ended up being old oil. He called me and asked me to pick him up and take him to the store.. we ended up getting the oil and calling it a day and went and got burritos after. I‚Äôll never forget how hard we were both laughing just staring at the green machine, oil less and all. 

Another favorite memory I have is when Garrett ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù Venmoed me a thousand dollars. I was on a flight home and my phone connected to the WiFi and I got a Venmo notification saying that he sent me a thousand dollars. He proceeded to comment on his Venmo by saying that he meant to request it as a joke. Let‚Äôs just say he was waiting for my plane to land on the dot. He didn‚Äôt see any money being taken from his account and when I told him it would take a day or so to process he said ‚ÄúNo way. We just created money from thin air‚Äù. When I asked him what he wanted to do he said ‚ÄúLETS DO IT AGAIN‚Äù. I ended up sending all his money back! When I got back to the island he requested me on Venmo and asked me to pay him twenty thousand dollars. It was so funny. 

From surfing together to green machine rap battles to endless temple trips to Sunday dinners at grandpas to fun trips to town to underwater cave diving to flips off Waimea rock to wedding crashers to so many catch up phone calls, I‚Äôm so so grateful I knew Garrett. He has changed my life and has pushed me to be a better Disciple of Jesus Christ every day since the day I met him. His example still pushes me to be better and always will. 

Thanks for everything Gary! I miss you like a banshee!

We filled the entire trunk of his car to the brim with cut up tree trunks and then strapped on two or three big pine trees to the top of it christmas tree style to take them to the dump.

Garrett was good at deciding to make life exciting. It didn‚Äôt really matter what we were doing, maybe we decided to hunt for a boomerang, maybe we wanted to connect three massive speakers together to listen to a new song in his car, or maybe we decided to go to the temple. Maybe it was entering into the ward‚Äôs soup competition with a mix of soda and icecream and bribing all the kids to vote for it (we got 2nd place). With Garrett there, it was ALWAYS a party.


Garrett loved life. He loved people, he loved his family. I‚Äôm so grateful for so many amazing memories. He was the biggest example of a disciple of Christ.

I have so many fond memories of Sunday family dinners at the Nichols home, always trying to be in with the ‚Äúbig kids‚Äù, and getting discouraged that I wouldn‚Äôt make the cut. Garrett would always make sure us ‚Äúlittle‚Äù cousins were included in the activities - or he would take us outside to the half-pipe and show off his scooter skills, encouraging us to try something out. We‚Äôd play hide-and-go-seek, tag, cops vs robbers. Or we would sit beside the trampoline and egg him on while he and David Grant would showcase an array of seemingly impossible feats. Garrett was especially kind to my little and only brother, Ezra, who being constantly surrounded be girls, would find solace in the excitement and craziness that was the Nichols brothers. 

About a month ago I moved back to Atascadero where we grew up, and about two weeks ago I went to church to see some old friends, where I ran into my Auntie Chantel. She invited me over and said that Garrett and Uncle Dave would be getting back from Santa Cruz that evening so we could all catch up. We sat on the back porch next to the fire and ate pints of ice cream. Garrett was super interested in what I had been up to. We talked for a few hours and caught up on anything and everything. Garrett didn‚Äôt let me leave without cracking a few jokes - and one that I have since told repeatedly after - ‚ÄúDid you know that Australia actually founded Norway? They came up one this random land and they were like ‚ÄúNORWAYY‚Äù. Classic Garrett. It felt so good to see them all, and what a blessing it is to have gotten to see Garrett one last time. 

When I think of Garrett, I just think of his smile. I don‚Äôt think I have ever caught Garrett not smiling. He radiated joy. Garrett inspires me to reach out to more people. Being able to see in real time the stories of his never ending kindness, shows the impact of introducing yourself, making a friend, doing acts of service. Truly making a difference and living life to the absolute fullest. Garrett will continue to be an example to me, and my siblings I‚Äôm sure, of kindness and of joy. A reminder to always smile and see the silver-lining, to spread love and kindness to everyone around us. 

Thank you Garrett for everything you have taught me. I have comfort that you are in a better place, with the biggest smile across your face, doing what you love. #LiveLikeGarrett `,

I will sincerely miss Garrett's smile and Love and Joy as an ordinance worker in the Laie Hawaii Temple. He was so committed and dedicated to his Temple shift. One night, when it was pouring rain, Garrett offered to walk me to my car under his umbrella. He was so kind and thoughtful. Garrett helped in the laundry to fold clothes, socks, happily and cheerfully. I will miss his kindness and thoughtfulness and dedication in the Temple.

Our mission president called me to tell me that he was sending me the hardest working missionary that was there and to give it our all to see what our area had. And boy was Garrett up to the challenge. 

We worked day and night for the following weeks. Garrett would always jump out of bed right when our alarms would go off and work until there was no more time to work anymore. His energy and positive attitude rubbed off on everyone around us. He was never afraid to talk to anyone or get out of his comfort zone to further the Lord's work. His testimony was always firm in the Savior, and he wanted everyone else to know what he knew. 

I will always cherish my time with Garrett. He truly changed my life and helped mold my mission. He taught me everything that I needed to know and never accepted no for an answer. His Christlike attitude and true discipleship showed me what it takes to truly become like Christ. I am forever grateful for the impact that Garrett had on my life and the people around us.

I am so grateful for the brief time I had to be with him while he was here in mortality. Most of our communication was limited to Pday, first his and then mine, but I consider him a great friend. A sister to my sister is my brother. 
I wish I could've had more time to hang out with him, he could push me off higher bridges into deeper water, teach me how to surf like he flippin promised, we could speak Spanglish together, and geek out about genealogy and temple work. I don't think he knew this, but he really helped me out at the begging of my mission. Because here was a rubio guapo from Cali who could speak perfect Spanish. How did he get so far? I would watch his Facebook videos to learn how he spoke and taught quick principals of the gospel. We even used his videos as models for our mission Facebook page that has grown from 15,000 to 45,000 followers since. Of the nearly 300 baptisms this year, probably two thirds come from a facebook page that he influenced. He's helped so many people in Puerto Rico come to Christ! An island that he hasn't even step foot on!
More importantly he had confidence that was so admirable. I only had one day with him in person, but it was like we'd been friends for years. He's just like that, he just loves everyone! "The accomplishment of the Father's will was never lost sight of as the object of [Garrett's] Supreme desire."

Garrett and I both know that there is a work to be done here. On both sides of the veil there are people waiting for the temporal and eternal joy that awaits them. I know for a fact that he's already hard at work. He never stopped. I hope to be like Garrett Nichols one day. I never want to stop being a missionary. I never want to stop being a disciple of the Lord. ¬°Vive como √©l!   I read this today and thought it described exactly how I see Garrett, as well as all the other faithful saints:

"from among the righteous, [Christ] organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead. 

And the chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of the Lord and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.

it was made known among [them], both small and great, the unrighteous as well as the faithful, that redemption had been wrought through the sacrifice of the Son of God upon the cross.

[The chosen] the Lord taught, and gave them power to come forth, after his resurrection from the dead, to enter into his Father‚Äôs kingdom, there to be crowned with immortality and eternal life, 

And continue thenceforth their labor as had been promised by the Lord, and be partakers of all blessings which were held in reserve for them that love him.

They were also among the noble and great ones who were chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God. 

 Even before they were born, they, with many others, received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.

The faithful elders of this dispensation (such as Garrett), when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel

Not only would he drop you off but he‚Äôd be sure to entertain you on the way! He loved making people laugh & his own laugh was contagious.

Our family has only felt a portion of the grief you are experiencing, but the last three days have been excruciating for us. In the short time we have been in-laws we have come to love you dearly. 

We knew Garrett long before we met him through your stories and his social media posts - and he has always been a bright, inspirational, and fun and deeply faithful example of discipleship and dedication to the Savior. He probably has no idea how much he has blessed our lives and will continue to do so until we meet him again. 

Our stake high council has been praying with all of us on your behalf this week. In our meeting this morning our stake president said, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt stop looking at Garrett‚Äôs instagram this week and I just wept when I saw all of his posts. Every single thing about Garrett testifies of his love for Jesus Christ and his service to others. He is a perfect example of the kind of people we should all be.‚Äù He is right. 

Elder Joey Coleman also called us yesterday from the mission field to talk about how much he loves Garrett. He specifically mentioned his gratitude for all the help and encouragement he received from Garrett in preparing to serve, learning the language, and just hanging in there during the difficult early months of his service in Puerto Rico. It seeks like there is not a soul who ever met Garrett who wasn‚Äôt changed for the better. 

Our hearts are knit together with yours during this tender time (D&C 42:46). We love you and we look forward in faith with you to the great reunion that will surely come, and for the day when ‚ÄúGod shall wipe away all tears‚Äù from our eyes (Rev 7:17).

We tried everything to get the little piece out! We made a contraption out of tape, tried to vacuum it out, and finally decided to drive the car to a steep hill thinking the part would roll out of the shaft because of the incline. Now, that was a stupid idea and that definitely didn‚Äôt work ahahah! I don‚Äôt remember how we actually got the part out but eventually we did. He fixed his AC and the dashboard was put back together. He then decided that he needed to straight pipe his car lol

I love Garrett and all of his crazy ideas! I will miss him everyday. I have so many more memories. He is truly the best person anyone could know!

I never once heard him speak badly about anybody. He was always the first to include everyone in his crazy fun adventures, and I always felt the spirit so strongly whenever I was around him. I will forever cherish our trips to the temple for baptisms, our drives blasting music and laughing our heads off, our trips to Haleiwa to paddle board under the bridge, cliff jumping, hanging out at FHE, surfing at Sunset, and drives to Costco. Garrett made me laugh like nobody else. My heart hurts knowing I won‚Äôt hear that amazing laugh of his for a while, but I have peace in knowing that I‚Äôll see him again.

You and little Dave had been enjoying it for a while by the time we came to visit. Our boys wanted to skate but they were unsure of the ramp. You spent the whole afternoon showing them how to ride it and encouraging them to drop in. I became a big fan of yours that day and admired you through the years as you continued to show that same kindness to everyone around you. After you died, Luke said, "Let's live for those that don't get to." You inspired all of us in life and continue to inspire us now as we strive to honor your memory by shining bright in our lives like you did in yours. We know you continue to share your light on the other side of the veil. Aloha 'oe.`,

He told us shepherds check their sheep at the door for the wounds of the day, then they minister to every one of them before sheltering them at night. That stuck with me in a very personal way and significantly changed the relationships most precious to me. It‚Äôs been several years, but I still think of it often.

Thank you, Garrett for all your positive energy in class. Thank you for speaking up during uncomfortable lulls after making sure others had a chance. Thank you for learning the Thriller dance at our party so my lame idea didn‚Äôt flop. Thanks for all the bonfires you announced on Friday mornings, so kids wouldn't be sitting at home later that night. You led and loved like a good shepherd (which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre still doing).

Garrett was my first Roommate at BYUH. That day he invited me to go to the temple for baptisms. I later worked for him doing landscaping. I have never met a more genuine kid in my life.

I met Garrett working on a wedding at Kualoa Ranch. We were on different teams- me catering and him for the wedding planner. Throughout the night he kept helping us with our tasks while still managing his own from his director. After that he would always say hi to me on campus or ask how I was if it had been a minute. I went to a taco party at his house and I‚Äôm sure he invited everyone he could as we ran out of food and his taco ended up solely filled with lettuce and sour cream. He was the kind of person to offer 100% of himself, however he could. BYUH ohana will not be the same without him ~ @brynhunt

Garrett and I knew eachother in highschool due to swim, waterpolo, and different classes we had together. We became good buddies and the first thing that pops in my head about Garrett is how thoughtful and positive he was.

Garrett would want all to know that his absence is only temporary. Although this time is very painful, Garrett is watching us from above. Becuase of Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for all mankind, we will all be able to live again one day.

Garret exemplified what it meant to be a true follower and disciple of Christ. He shared the gospel whenever he could. He quickly became known as missionary Garrett in my friend group at BYUH.

I‚Äôm grateful for the time I got to spend working with him and will always admire the example he set. May we all strive to further the light you left behind.

Garret was there for me when I didn‚Äôt have rides home and was the first person to invite me to skimboard. He was very nice and pains me to know he isn‚Äôt with us.

Garrett was one of my first friends in Hawaii and loved you immediately and was so inclusive, and willing to serve! He always made time for the most important things. He was always everywhere he wanted to be no matter what, countless times he would pull up to pounders for a 15 or 20 minute session in between classes or meetings! Garrett loved everyone! It's easy to say "Garrett was this or that..." But I know Garrett is still those things that we love! For he is not dead, he is risen.~ @yes_man_tan

Garrett reached out to everyone and was a real friend while I was at BYUH. We called him missionary Garrett in order to distinguish him in conversation between our other friends named Garrett.

Rip Garrett, I worked with this awesome dude since January of 2024. As time went on we started to develop a friendship. We would go an adventures such as him teaching me to skateboard, going to the beach such as Pounders, Waimea Rock, and etc. I remember going to eat Tacos at this one place in Haleiwa. I would joke with him he would joke with me. We would eat lunch together during our breaks. I loved hearing his stories he told me of his childhood and his mission. Even my haircut as of right now was from him. He was a super hard worker, I looked up to him. I know he‚Äôs definitely fine in Heaven. He was very covenant to God. Once again RIP Garrett.

Garrett was a gatherer. Every Thursday night he would bring a group of BYUH students to the temple to do baptisms. We as workers were amazed at the many people he brought to the House of the Lord.

Garrett was the first person that I met at BYUH. He come up to and immediately invited me to be his friend. That next day he took me surfing for my first time. Garrett was a disciple on in this life and is no doubt in my mind doing the same thing in the next life.

I was Garrett‚Äôs TA for Econ. He was goofy, kind, caring, and a hard worker.

I‚Äôm so grateful I got to spend a year together with him at BYUH before I left on my mission.

I remember one day I was with Garret and some friends in his car driving along the North Shore going to the beach. We passed by a guy who parked his big black truck in a place that left the front wheels in a ditch and now he could not get it out. Immediately Garret pulls over and starts talking to the guy to help him out. We all end up trying to push this guy's car while he spins the wheels hoping it will budge. After 20 solid minutes of us trying many things and Garret trying to figure how to help this guy it becomes clear we can't do anything more so we leave and the guy calls someone to pull out his truck. I saw this reactiveness to an opportunity to serve as an example of what a return missionary should look like and the kind of person Garret is.

I remember many times where I would be in his car going to an event, going to the beach or to Grandpa's and he would be blasting music and singing along to it. It was fun to be around him and he brought a joyful spirit to those he was with.`,

I think back now about my memories with Garrett and I can't even think of a time when he wasn't smiling. Garrett was always the life of every room. Whether the room was full of people he had never met or if it was just you and him, he was doing something to make you laugh or smile. 

Garret reached out to me before my mission and I got to talk to him a little bit about the experience and what I was scared of and what I was excited for. At that time I was very greatful to receive that encouragement from him, but of course now in hindsight that brief interaction has had so much more of an impact on me. Those were the last few things Garrett ever talked to me about, encouraging me and hyping me up for my mission. 

Of the memories I recall of Garrett I remember also all the times I've heard people share their memories of Garrett. Garrett really did and still does touch so many lives, even Sistet Barton, a sister in my MTC district knew of Garrett and had only amazing things to say about him. Even leading up to just a few days before receiving the call about Garrett, I had spoken about him multiple times in study and in meetings with my companion as someone I looked up to as a missionary. 

I'm grateful for Garret, all that he has done for me, for others, and for all he has done for the Lord. 

As I fasted and prayed for our  family, especially Garrett's family, I broke down in tears and get close to it now even in writing this, because all I could envision in my head while praying was Garrett in the temple. I've never served or attended the temple with Garrett. Yet, that was all I could envision as I prayed for him and his family. 

I know that Garrett is back home now. I know Garrett served the Lord valiantly here in his mortal life and I know he will on the other side of the veil. 

I'm grateful for Garrett and the light he shared with everyone around him. 

I'm excited to see him again someday.`,

        message: `I met Garrett when he spent the summer of 2024 in Santa Cruz and attended the Ocean YSA Branch.  Even though the Branch is small, Garrett was "all in" and involved in meetings and activities.  His outgoing and inclusive nature allowed him to make friends quickly and easily.  His faith and conviction showed itself in thoughtful and heartfelt participation in church meetings.  Most Branch activities included food and Garrett always brought things to share, ate his share of food and helped clean up.  The Sunday before he returned to Hawaii was Testimony Meeting and he was the first one to speak and share his love of the Lord.  Attached is a photo of Garrett and other Branch members wearing their "Santa Cruz" socks.  When Branch members leave the Branch, my wife Debbie and I give them "Santa Cruz" socks to remind them of their time in Branch (which meets in Santa Cruz).  Garrett immediately put his socks on and pulled them up over his pants so they were very visible.  While I'm sorry that his time in this life wasn't longer, I'm thankful to have known him.`,

The amount of times he pulled to the side of the road to offer me or others a ride was too many to count. In one word Garrett is FUN! Always up to something crazy and being awesome. He will be missed here but he is very needed where he is going, because he is just that special! `,

Although we never had a deep friendship I would always see him around, he was always smiling, always in good spirits and crazy athletic. It‚Äôs true when they say the good go young. He was a great guy. I spoke to him earlier today In spirit. Sending him good wishes and letting him know everything will be okay in gods hands. My condolences to his loved ones. I know he is shining with god as we speak. `,

What makes me so different from him? I‚Äôm 21 he‚Äôs 21. He did all the things any great kid would do. He believed In something greater than life but unfortunately he had to have his taken away at such a young age. Living in Atascadero were some of the best times of my life and it hurts knowing that I lost someone that I met along the way. Although we did not have a deep connection his memory still stands strong in my mind and heart. That goes to show how bright his spirit was. He left an impact on everyone he met. And he will definitely be missed. To his parents , do not feel discouraged for you have served your son extremely well considering how much of a light he grew to be. I know it will be hard and I know it will be rough but never forget he is always with you. Death is not the end but the beginning of something new. Sending love from Marietta, Georgia‚ô•Ô∏è. May god protect you and your family and let him guide you through this tough time with proper care and protection. Amen üôèüèø. Stay safe to everyone reading this. `,

        message: `Garrett and I first met in Alaska where we were assigned to be mission companions. I remember when we first started working together it struck me how hard working and dedicated he was to being a disciple of Jesus Christ. One of the most meaningful lessons I learned from his example was what a sincere prayer to God looked like.
Each night before going to bed I would see him walk to the other room, kneel down, and pray out loud to God. He would be there sometimes for 15 or 20 minutes, then come back with a smile on his face.
I am lucky enough to have heard Garrett testify of Jesus Christ multiple times a day for almost a year. Garrett knew who his Savior was. He knew what his purpose on earth was. And he never once doubted his faith.

Garrett is fun, energetic, compassionate, and a huge goofball. But even through his silliness and fun loving attitude, he is one of the most rightous and loving guys I have ever known. 
He was an example to me in so many ways during that time and became one of my best friends. During that time I felt like he was my brother. He always treated me kindly, made me feel valued, and was a trustworthy and true friend.

Just a little over a month ago Garrett came to join my wedding as one of my groomsmen. I couldn't have been more honored to have such a great friend attend the biggest moment of my life this far.
In Alaska we talked about our futures, our goals in life, and who we wanted to become. He wanted to go to school, work, get married in the temple and become a dad one day. 
I know that in so many ways Garrett didn't get to do all that he wanted here, but I know that one day all those things will happen for him. In Gods own way and His own time, He is directing Garretts path. Although Garrett isn't on earth, his spirit lives on.

Garrett, I look forward to catching up with you after this life. Till we meet again.

        message: `I first met Garrett in a religion class, we had two Garretts in the class and so to solve the problem the teacher asked if either of them had a nickname. To which Garrett happily said, you can call me Toasty. The name stuck and I never called him anything else. He was a literal bundle of joy, he came into class smiling, saying hi to everyone, opening the door for people. He was good friends with one of my roommates and was always over at the house. He always knew how to make me smile, he made the most ridiculous jokes and could make anymore feel comfortable. I would plan movie nights with my girlfriends and he would randomly pull up bubbly and ready with the funniest comments. 
Toasty was a good person, and he was always ready to share his testimony and ready to help. I‚Äôll miss him. `,

        message: `Garrett and I so so quickly became good friends. One day he invited me to go jump the point with him. I struggle with social anxiety (especially during that time of my life), and we barely knew even each other. On top of that I don‚Äôt like cliff jumping but with almost no hesitation‚Ä¶ I went. Saying yes to any adventure with Garrett was so easy and so natural. He has such a soft yet bold spirit that i automatically felt safe around without even realizing it. 
So we rushed over to the point in between classes, jumped, and rushed back to our next classes late and soaking wet. After we got some of the worst most flavorless chicken katsu we‚Äôve ever had, and again rushed to our next class. It was quite the chaotic day and I‚Äôm sure we both left an interesting impression on our teachers beginning of the semester but I absolutely loved that day and I don‚Äôt regret a single thing‚Ä¶ especially because that was a start to one of my most favorite and dearest friendships I‚Äôve ever had the blessing to be a part of. Oh my goodness I love Garrett (aka Cakehead). `,
